1. **Difference Between Let and Var**:
   - `var` is function-scoped while `let` is block-scoped. Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, meaning they are visible throughout the whole function. `let` is block-scoped, so it's only visible within the block it's declared in (like `for` loops or `if` statements).

2. **Difference and Similarities Between Let and Const**:
   - Both `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
   - `let` allows reassignment, while `const` doesn't. Once a value is assigned to `const`, it cannot be reassigned to another value.
   - Both need to be initialized during declaration.
   - `let` can be reassigned, while `const` values are immutable.

3. **Why to use 'use strict'**:
   - `'use strict'` enables stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript. It helps catch common coding mistakes and prevents the use of undeclared variables, among other things.

4. **What is the use of Typeof**:
   - `typeof` is used to determine the type of a variable or expression in JavaScript. It returns a string representing the data type of the operand.

5. **Which Operator is Overloaded**:
   - JavaScript does not support operator overloading, unlike some other programming languages like C++.
