
1. **Difference Between Rest and Spread**:
    - The rest (`...`) operator gathers elements into an array or collects function arguments into an array.
    - The spread (`...`) operator spreads elements of an array or object into individual elements.

2. **What Is Arguments Keyword**:
    - The `arguments` keyword is an array-like object available inside functions that contain the values of all the arguments passed to that function.

3. **How to Make an Object Immutable**:
    - Object immutability can be achieved by using `Object.freeze()` to prevent changes to object properties.

4. **State Method in Object Class**:
    - There isn't a specific `state` method in the Object class in JavaScript.

5. **How to Make a Class Abstract**:
    - JavaScript doesnâ€™t have built-in abstract classes, but you can simulate them by throwing an error if an abstract method is not implemented in the subclass.
