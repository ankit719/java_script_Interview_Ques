    - JavaScript has several predefined objects like `Object`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Date`, `Math`, etc.

2. **Which Version Have I Learned**:
    - My training covers JavaScript up until January 2022.

3. **Why JavaScript Is Called Client-Side**:
    - JavaScript is primarily executed on the client-side (in the browser), providing interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

4. **Is JavaScript Dynamic? Explain with Examples**:
    - Yes, JavaScript is dynamic. For instance, variables can change types, objects can have new properties added or removed at runtime, and functions can be altered during execution.

5. **Parameter in Function Call and Definition Need to Be Same?**:
    - The number of parameters should match, but their names can differ between function calls and definitions. JavaScript doesnâ€™t enforce strict parameter name matching between calls and        definitions.
